}",2733,263,"[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets
A call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata is made in `fillZrxQuote()`, which means the contract can be an ERC20 token, and the calldata can be `transferFrom` a previously approved user.
  [H-02] Wrong calculation of erc20Delta and ethDelta
“function fillZrxQuote()”
When a user tries to swap unwrapped ETH to ERC20, even if there is a certain amount of ETH refunded, at L215, `ethDelta` will always be 0.
That's because `originalETHBalance` already includes the `msg.value` sent by the caller.
Let's say the ETH balance of the contract is 1 ETH before the swap.
- A user swaps 10 ETH to USDC;
- `originalETHBalance` will be 11 ETH;
- If there is 1 ETH of refund;
- `ethDelta` will be 0 as the new balance is 2 ETH and `subOrZero(2, 11)` is 0.
Similarly, erc20Delta is also computed wrong.
Consider a special case of a user trying to arbitrage from WBTC to WBTC, the `originalERC20Balance` already includes the input amount, erc20Delta will always be much lower than the actual delta amount.
For example, for an arb swap from 1 WBTC to 1.1 WBTC, the ethDelta will be 0.1 WBTC while it should be 1.1 WBTC.
  [M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer
The use of `transfer()` in  Swap.sol may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the msg.sender or feeRecipient is a smart contract. Funds can potentially be lost if;
The smart contract fails to implement the payable fallback function
The fallback function uses more than 2300 gas units
The latter situation may occur in the instance of gas cost changes. The impact would mean that any contracts receiving funds would potentially be unable to retrieve funds from the swap.   [M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded
Based on the context and comments in the code, we assume that it's possible that there will be some leftover sell tokens, not only when users are selling unwrapped ETH but also for ERC20 tokens.
However, in the current implementation, only refunded ETH is returned (L158).
Because of this, the leftover tkoens may be left in the contract unintentionally.
 
[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps
Users can call `Swap.swapByQuote()` to execute an ETH swap (where they receive ETH) without paying swap fee for the gained ETH. They can trick the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to an address of a malicious contract and making it think they have executed an ERC20 swap when they have actually executed an ETH swap. In this case, the system will give them the ETH they got from the swap (`boughtETHAmount`) without charging any swap fees for it, because the systems consideres this ETH as ""refunded ETH"" that wasn't part of the ""ERC20"" swap.",5,"pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

}",1505,2,3,"Identified vulnerabilities:
1. **Integer Overflow/Underflow in `Math` library** *(CRITICAL)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `Math` library used in the contract does not provide safe arithmetic operations. If the `mul` or `sub` functions are used with very large or small values, they can result in integer overflows or underflows, which could lead to incorrect calculations.  For example, `SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR.sub(swapFee)` could underflow if `swapFee` is greater than `SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR`.
   
   **Impact:**  
   Incorrect fee calculations could lead to users being charged less than intended, or receiving more tokens than they should. This could also lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the contract.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Replace unsafe math operations with SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ built-in safety
   uint256 toTransfer = SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR.sub(swapFee); // This is unsafe in Solidity < 0.8.0
   // Use SafeMath instead:
   // toTransfer = SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR.sub(swapFee);
   // toTransfer = toTransfer.mul(boughtERC20Amount).div(SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR);
   ```

2. **Reentrancy Vulnerability in `fillZrxQuote`** *(High)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `fillZrxQuote` function uses a low-level `call` to execute external code. This can lead to a reentrancy attack if the external contract calls back into the `fillZrxQuote` function before it completes execution.
   
   **Impact:**  
   An attacker could potentially drain the contract's funds by recursively calling the `fillZrxQuote` function before the original call completes.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Use a reentrancy guard to prevent reentrant calls
   // Add the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
   // contract Swap is EmergencyPausable, ReentrancyGuard {... }
   // function fillZrxQuote(...) internal nonReentrant {... }
   ```

3. **Unprotected `setSwapFee` and `setFeeRecipient`** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `setSwapFee` and `setFeeRecipient` functions are protected by the `onlyTimelock` modifier, which is not defined in the provided code. If the `onlyTimelock` modifier is not properly implemented, these functions could be called by any address, allowing unauthorized users to set the swap fee and fee recipient.
   
   **Impact:**  
   Unauthorized users could set the swap fee to 0, effectively allowing them to receive tokens for free, or set the fee recipient to their own address.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Ensure the onlyTimelock modifier is properly implemented
   // function setSwapFee(uint256 swapFee_) external onlyTimelock {
   //     require(swapFee_ < SWAP_FEE_DIVISOR, ""Swap::setSwapFee: Swap fee must not exceed 100%"");
   //     swapFee = swapFee_;
   //     emit NewSwapFee(swapFee);
   // }
   // function setFeeRecipient(address payable feeRecipient_) external onlyTimelock {
   //     feeRecipient = feeRecipient_;
   //     emit NewFeeRecipient(feeRecipient);
   // }
   ```

4. **Unprotected `sweepFees`** *(Medium)*:  
   **Description:**  
   The `sweepFees` function is protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier, but it transfers the entire contract balance to the fee recipient without any checks or restrictions on the recipient's address.
   
   **Impact:**  
   An attacker could potentially drain the contract's balance by setting the fee recipient to their own address.

   **Mitigation:**  
   ```solidity
   // Add a check to ensure the fee recipient is valid
   function sweepFees(
       address[] calldata tokens
   ) external nonReentrant {
       require(
           feeRecipient!= address(0),
           ""Swap::withdrawAccruedFees: feeRecipient is not initialized""
       );
       for (uint8 i = 0; i<tokens.length; i++) {
           uint256 balance = IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
           if (balance > 0) {
               IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, balance);
               emit FeesSwept(tokens[i], balance, feeRecipient);
           }
       }
       require(feeRecipient!= address(0), ""Swap::withdrawAccruedFees: feeRecipient","### **Comparison of Issue Report and Response List**

---

#### **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**

**Report Description**:  
The `fillZrxQuote()` function makes a call to an arbitrary contract with custom calldata, which could be an ERC20 token with `transferFrom` calldata targeting a previously approved user. This allows attackers to steal ERC20 tokens from users' wallets.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Reentrancy Vulnerability in `fillZrxQuote`""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the use of a low-level `call` in `fillZrxQuote` and correctly flags it as a reentrancy risk. However, it does not address the specific issue of arbitrary contract calls enabling ERC20 token theft. The response focuses on reentrancy but misses the broader security concern of unauthorized token transfers.

---

#### **[H-02] Wrong calculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`**

**Report Description**:  
The `fillZrxQuote()` function incorrectly calculates `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta`. For ETH swaps, `ethDelta` is always `0` because `originalETHBalance` includes `msg.value`. Similarly, `erc20Delta` is miscalculated when arbitraging between the same token (e.g., WBTC to WBTC), leading to incorrect delta values.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The miscalculation of `erc20Delta` and `ethDelta` is a critical flaw that could lead to incorrect token transfers and financial losses. This issue is entirely missed in the response list.

---

#### **[M-01] Swap.sol implements potentially dangerous transfer**

**Report Description**:  
The use of `transfer()` in `Swap.sol` may result in unintended outcomes when sending ETH to smart contracts. If the recipient contract's fallback function uses more than 2300 gas or is not payable, funds may be irretrievable or undelivered.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The use of `transfer()` for ETH transfers is a known vulnerability in Solidity, especially when interacting with smart contracts. This issue is entirely missed in the response list.

---

#### **[M-02] Unused ERC20 tokens are not refunded**

**Report Description**:  
The current implementation only refunds ETH, leaving unused ERC20 tokens in the contract. This could result in unintended token accumulation, especially when users sell unwrapped ETH or ERC20 tokens.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The failure to refund unused ERC20 tokens is a medium-severity issue that could lead to financial losses for users. This issue is entirely missed in the response list.

---

#### **[M-03] Users can avoid paying fees for ETH swaps**

**Report Description**:  
Users can exploit the system by setting `zrxBuyTokenAddress` to a malicious contract, tricking the system into treating an ETH swap as an ERC20 swap. This allows them to receive ETH without paying swap fees.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue. The ability to bypass swap fees is a medium-severity issue that could lead to financial losses for the protocol. This issue is entirely missed in the response list.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:  
- *None*

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-01] Arbitrary contract call allows attackers to steal ERC20 from users' wallets**
