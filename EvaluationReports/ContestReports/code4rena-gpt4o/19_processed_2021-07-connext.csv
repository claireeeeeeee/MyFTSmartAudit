// Outstanding qs:
// - what happens if you have unique user data, but duplicate tx ids?
//   no requires here would catch this, the tx would be properly prepared
//
// - we validate all the inputs but the amount, bidSignature, and encodedBid.
//   bidSignature and encodedBid could be used as slashing later, and their
//   validation is out of scope of this function. But, do we want to be able
//   to use this to send 0-value amounts? basically as some incentivized
//   relayer? would that break bidding?


/// @title TransactionManager
/// @author Connext <support@connext.network>
/// @notice This contract holds the logic to facilitate crosschain transactions.
///         Transactions go through three phases:
///
///         1. Route Auction: User broadcasts to our network signalling their 
///         desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing 
///         commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and 
///         price range.
///
///         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
///         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
///         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
///         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chiain. Upon 
///         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
///         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
///         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
///         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
///         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
///         transaction.
///
///         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
///         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
///         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
///         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
///         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
///         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
///         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
///         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
///         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
///         unlocking the original `amount`.
///
///         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it 
///         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on 
///         each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled 
///         unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for 
///         sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.

}",6657,654,"[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity
The `addLiquidity()` function takes a router address parameter, whose liquidity is increased (instead of assuming that `router` == `msg.sender` like is done on `removeLiquidity()`) on this contract/chain, by transferring the fund amount from router address to this contract if `assetID` != 0 (i.e. ERC20 tokens). However, anyone can call this function on the router’s behalf. For assetID == 0, the Ether transfer via msg.value comes from msg.sender and hence is assumed to be the router itself.
The impact is that this will allow anyone to call this function and arbitrarily move ERC20 tokens from router address to this contract, assuming router has given max approval to this contract and has assetID amount available for transfer. While the router can always remove the liquidity if it doesn’t want to maintain that level of liquidity, this lack of access control or flexibility for a relayer to add liquidity on router’s behalf, may unnecessarily (and without authorization) increase the router’s exposure to protocol risk to more than it desires. See TransactionManager.sol #L88-L98. See also, use of msg.sender in removeLiquidity (#L88-L98).
  [H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks
There is a potential issue in function `removeUserActiveBlocks` and the for loop inside it. I assume you are aware of block gas limits (they may be less relevant on other chains but still needs to be accounted for), so as there is no limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`, it may grow so large that the for loop may never finish. You should consider introducing an upper limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`. Also, a malicious actor may block any account (DDOS) by just calling `prepare` again and again with 0 amount acting as a router. This will push `activeTransactionBlocks` to the specified user until it is no longer possible to remove them from the array.
This is also a gas issue, as function `removeUserActiveBlocks` iterating and assigning large dynamic arrays is very gas-consuming. Consider optimizing the algorithm, e.g. finding the first occurrence, then swap it with the last item, pop the array, and break. Or maybe even using an EnumerableMap, so you can find and remove elements in O(1).
The best solution depends on what the usual number of `activeTransactionBlocks` is. If it is expected to be low (e.g. less than 5), then the current approach will work. But with larger arrays, I expect EnumerableMap would be more efficient.
Because an upper limit will not fully mitigate this issue, as a malicious actor can still DDOS the user by pushing useless txs until this limit is reached and a valid router may not be able to submit new txs. And, because you need to improve both the security and performance of removeUserActiveBlocks; EnumerableMap may be a go-to solution.
  [H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user
During `fulfill()` on the receiving chain, if the user has set up an external contract at `txData.callTo`, the catch blocks for both `IFulfillHelper.addFunds()` and `IFulfillHelper.excute()` perform `transferAsset` to the predetermined fallback address `txData.receivingAddress`.
If `addFunds()` has reverted earlier, `toSend` amount would already have been transferred to the `receivingAddress`. If `execute()` also fails, it is again transferred.
  [H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain function `cancel()`
The cancelling relayer is being paid in `receivingAssetId` on the sendingChain instead of in sendingAssetID. If the user relies on a relayer to cancel transactions, and that receivingAssetId asset does not exist on the sending chain (assuming only sendingAssetID on the sending chain and receivingAssetId on the receiving chain are assured to be valid and present), then the cancel transaction from the relayer will always revert and user’s funds will remain locked on the sending chain.
The impact is that expired transfers can never be cancelled and user funds will be locked forever if user relies on a relayer.
  [H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to IFulfillHelper fails
The function `fulfill` first approves the `callTo` to transfer an amount of toSend tokens and tries to call IFulfillHelper, but if the call fails, it transfers these assets directly. However, in such case the approval is not reset, so a malicous callTo can pull these tokens later:   [M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest
The signature check in `recoverFulfillSignature()` only uses transaction ID (along with the relayer fee) which can be accidentally reused by the user, in which case the older signatures with the older relayer fees can be replayed. The signature should be on the entire digest hashInvariantTransactionData(txData) as indicated in the comment on L306.
The impact is that, If the user signatures are indeed on the digest as indicated by the comment, the signature/address check in fulfill() will fail. If not, they may be accidentally/intentionally replayed with same transaction ID, which also appears to be an outstanding question as indicated by the comment on L12.
  [M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers
The agreement between the `user` and the `router` seems to already happen off-chain because all the fields are required for the initial In `variantTransactionData call already. A router could pretend to take on a user's cross-chain transfer, the user sends their prepare transaction, locking up funds on the sending chain. But then the router simply doesn't respond or responds with a prepare transaction of amount=0.
The user's funds are then locked for the entire expiry time, whereas the router does not have to lock up anything as the amount is 0, even no gas if they simply don't respond. In this way, a router can bid on everything off-chain without a penalty, and take down everyone that accepts the bid.",7,"pragma solidity 0.8.4;

}",3101,5,2,"Upon reviewing the provided Solidity smart contract, here is a list of potential vulnerabilities or risks we can identify in the `TransactionManager` contract:

---

### 1. **Reentrancy Concerns Even with `ReentrancyGuard`**
- Although the `ReentrancyGuard` is included and used, reentrancy can still occur if third-party contracts within `LibAsset` or `IFulfillHelper` call back into this contract, especially invalidating sensitive state updates before external calls are made.
    - **Example Issues:**
      - The `fulfill()` function calls external contracts (e.g., `LibAsset.transferAsset` and `IFulfillHelper` calls). If these calls enable reentrancy or manipulate state improperly, they might lead to reentrancy risks.
      - The problem can become more severe if the external call sends tokens (ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155), as poorly implemented ERC20/ERC721 contracts might invoke unknown callbacks.

---

### 2. **Untrusted External Implementations (LibAsset, LibERC20, IFulfillHelper)**
- The usage of `LibAsset`, `LibERC20`, and `IFulfillHelper`, which are external libraries/interfaces, introduces trust assumptions on their correctness. If there are bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious implementations in these libraries, it could compromise the contract's security.
    - **Example Risks:**
      - The functions `LibERC20.transferFrom`, `LibAsset.transferAsset`, and other related calls could behave in unexpected ways and might not revert when tokens are not transferred properly.

---

### 3. **Lack of Safe Math Checks for Arithmetic Operations**
- While Solidity 0.8.x uses built-in overflow and underflow protections, rugging or manipulation issues may arise if there are improper assumptions in operations, especially involving user balances (`routerBalances`).
    - **Example Risks:**
      - In `removeLiquidity()`, subtracting the amount from `routerBalances` before validation might expose potential race conditions if the mapping relies heavily on expected balances across chains.
      - Off-chain discrepancies could occur between `routerBalances` and actual tokens held in the contract.

---

### 4. **Replay and Signature Risks**
- The contract verifies user and relayer signatures (via `ECDSA.recover`) but does not explicitly validate if a signature has already been used.
    - **Example Risks:**
      - Replay attacks: If a relayer or user re-submits a valid signature to replay a previously executed transaction, this could lead to abuse.
      - This affects `fulfill()` and `cancel()` functions where a signature is used.
    - **Mitigation Suggestion**:
      - Either maintain a mapping of used signatures or include a unique nonce in every signed message to prevent replays.

---

### 5. **No Restrictions on `addLiquidity` Router Validation**
- There's no validation to ensure that the `router` parameter in the `addLiquidity()` function is a trusted or whitelisted router.
    - **Example Risks:**
      - A malicious actor could call `addLiquidity` with themselves as the `router` and front-run transactions meant for legitimate routers, potentially leading to fund interceptions.
      - Untrusted routers being exploited could also drain liquidity, causing economic harm to participating users.

---

### 6. **Unbounded `activeTransactionBlocks` Array**
- The `activeTransactionBlocks` mapping (storing the block numbers of active transactions for each user) may grow indefinitely, leading to:
    - Increased storage gas costs for the user over time.
    - Potential performance bottlenecks when interacting with larger arrays.
    - Inefficiency when recalculating updated states, such as in `removeUserActiveBlocks()`.

---

### 7. **Potentially Insufficient Validation of `encodedBid` and `bidSignature`**
- The contract accepts `encodedBid` and `bidSignature` in the `prepare()` function but does not explicitly validate their correctness within the code (e.g., the signature or payload format).
    - **Example Risks:**
      - Invalid bids could be used to trigger fake transactions, potentially blocking legitimate routers.
    - **Mitigation Suggestion**:
      - Add stricter validation for `encodedBid` and `bidSignature` to ensure only legitimate bids are permitted.

---

### 8. **Centralization or Trust Assumptions in Critical Parameters**
- The contract assumes values such as `chainId`, `invariantData.router`, and external libraries behave honestly. Any compromise here could lead to significant vulnerabilities.
    - **Example Risks**:
      - The `chainId` parameter might not be sufficient for cross-chain logic, especially in scenarios where there are forks or chain ID mismatches.
      - A compromised router or dishonest relayer could falsify user transactions, potentially draining funds or disrupting legitimate processes.

---

### 9. **Insufficient Handling of Asset Approvals**
- Proper allowance handling (via `LibERC20.approve` and similar calls) should factor in race conditions or attackers attempting to abuse outdated allowances.
    - **Example Risks:**
      - In `fulfill()`, if the asset approval races with an external party draining allowances, the primary call could fail or behave unexpectedly.

---

### 10. **Time Sensitivity (Block.timestamp) Exploitation**
- The contract uses `block.timestamp` to enforce expiry (`expiry`) constraints on transactions. However, this method is susceptible to miner manipulation.
    - **Example Risks:**
      - If a miner sets a slightly incorrect timestamp (within permissible ranges), it could alter the timeout behavior for `prepare()`, `fulfill()`, or `cancel()` calls.

---

### 11. **Improper Event Emission or Logging**
- Events like `TransactionPrepared`, `TransactionFulfilled`, and others emit critical transaction data. If this data proves to be incomplete or tampered with off-chain, users might misinterpret execution results.
    - **Example Risks:**
      - A failure in off-chain relayers using event logs could result in incomplete transaction settlements or disputes.

---

### 12. **No Specific Upper Limit on Relayer Fees**
- While `fulfill` ensures `relayerFee <= txData.amount`, setting an absolute upper cap (value or percentage of the amount) would reduce the likelihood of malicious fee claims.
    - **Example Risks**:
      - A malicious router may purposefully inflate relayer fees, confusing participants who expect smaller transaction costs.

---

### 13. **Call Data Risks in `IFulfillHelper.execute`**
- The use of low-level function calls (e.g., `try IFulfillHelper(txData.callTo)...`) can lead to undefined behavior in the event of errors or malicious `callData` execution.
    - **Example Risks**:
      - Malicious `callData` could exploit a poorly implemented `callTo` function, draining tokens or causing denial-of-service on the `fulfill()` process.

---

### 14. **Unbounded Storage Growth**
- Key mappings such as `routerBalances`, `activeTransactionBlocks`, and `variantTransactionData` can grow indefinitely with user interaction, leading to:
    - Increased gas costs for storage operations.
    - Potential state bloat, leading to limits when interacting with the contract.

---

These are the primary vulnerabilities and risks identified in the contract. Many of them can be mitigated by:
- Implementing stricter validations.
- Adding replay protection.
- Establishing limits or constraints where appropriate.
- Refactoring external contracts/libraries to ensure trustworthiness.

---

### **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
The `addLiquidity()` function can be called by anyone, which can lead to arbitrary movement of ERC20 tokens from the router to this contract, if the router has granted approval to the contract. This lack of access control could unnecessarily increase the router’s exposure to protocol risks.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""No Restrictions on `addLiquidity` Router Validation""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response appropriately identifies that there is no validation on the `router` parameter in the `addLiquidity()` function. It highlights the risk of a malicious actor calling `addLiquidity` on behalf of the router, potentially front-running or intercepting liquidity. This aligns with best practices, where external addresses interacting with critical functions should be validated or whitelisted.

**Suggestions**:  
- Implement an access control mechanism for the `router` parameter to ensure only authorized routers can call the function.
- Consider adding a whitelisting mechanism or contract-level access control to restrict who can interact with this function.

---

### **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**

**Report Description**:  
The `removeUserActiveBlocks` function could become gas inefficient and potentially vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, where an attacker repeatedly triggers the function with a zero amount, causing the `activeTransactionBlocks` mapping to grow indefinitely, leading to high gas costs and performance issues.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unbounded `activeTransactionBlocks` Array""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response rightly identifies the potential problem of an unbounded `activeTransactionBlocks` array. This can cause performance issues and gas inefficiencies, as the array grows indefinitely. The suggestion to consider an upper limit on the size of the array and optimizing the algorithm for removal is also relevant.

**Suggestions**:  
- Implement a cap on the number of blocks that can be stored for each user in `activeTransactionBlocks`.
- Use efficient data structures (e.g., `EnumerableMap`) for better performance when removing elements.

---

### **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**

**Report Description**:  
The `fulfill()` function involves two calls to transfer assets to a `receivingAddress`, but if one of these calls fails, the assets may already be transferred, leading to a scenario where the funds are transferred multiple times, allowing the user to double-dip.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect/Unaddressed**. The response does not mention any potential issues related to double transfers or handling failures in `fulfill()`. This issue requires special attention to ensure that the transfer logic is atomic or has proper checks to prevent double spending.

**Suggestions**:  
- Introduce a rollback mechanism to ensure that only one transfer occurs, and if any part of the process fails, the entire transaction reverts to prevent double-dipping.
- Consider adding proper state checks to avoid asset duplication in failure scenarios.

---

### **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**

**Report Description**:  
The `cancel()` function involves paying the relayer in the `receivingAssetId` on the sending chain. If this asset does not exist on the sending chain, the cancellation will fail, leaving the user's funds locked indefinitely.

**Match in Response List**:  
No match found.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect/Unaddressed**. This issue is not directly addressed in the responses. The handling of the `receivingAssetId` in the `cancel()` function needs to ensure that both the sending and receiving chains have corresponding valid assets. Without this validation, the funds could be locked as described.

**Suggestions**:  
- Add checks to validate that the asset ID used in the `cancel()` function exists on the sending chain. If it doesn’t exist, ensure that the cancellation process does not lock user funds indefinitely.

---

### **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**

**Report Description**:  
In the `fulfill()` function, asset approvals are not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails. This can allow a malicious `callTo` to drain the tokens later.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""No Specific Upper Limit on Relayer Fees""**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect/Partially Correct**. While the response mentions the issue of relayer fees, it does not address the specific problem of resetting approvals after a failed call. This issue requires a mechanism to reset or revoke approvals if any function call that depends on them fails.

**Suggestions**:  
- Add logic to reset asset approvals if any part of the transaction fails (for example, in a `catch` block or a failure condition within `fulfill()`).
- Consider using a more secure pattern for managing allowances, such as using a ""pull"" pattern for transfers rather than ""push"".

---

### **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Report Description**:  
The signature verification only uses the transaction ID and relayer fee, which can be reused or replayed if the same ID is used in future transactions.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Replay and Signature Risks""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response correctly identifies the risk of replay attacks due to the signature being based only on the transaction ID. This is a valid security concern, and the suggestion to either maintain a mapping of used signatures or include a unique nonce is appropriate.

**Suggestions**:  
- Implement a nonce system or signature mapping to ensure that each transaction can only be executed once with a given signature.
- Consider using the full digest of the transaction, including all relevant fields, to prevent signature replay.

---

### **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain transfers**

**Report Description**:  
A malicious router can lock up user funds by submitting a `prepare` transaction with an amount of zero, preventing the user’s funds from being unlocked or moved.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Untrusted External Implementations (LibAsset, LibERC20, IFulfillHelper)""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. While the response mentions the trust assumptions of external libraries, it does not fully address the specific issue of the malicious router blocking cross-chain transfers by not responding or responding with zero. This needs more attention regarding how the router and its behavior should be validated.

**Suggestions**:  
- Implement additional checks on the router’s actions (e.g., ensuring they provide valid amounts) before allowing the transfer to proceed.
- Consider using a contract or oracle to ensure the router’s actions are valid and reliable.

---

### **GPT-Generated Potential Issues (May Be Incorrect)**

**[R-05] Reentrancy Concerns Even with `ReentrancyGuard`**  
**Response Description**:  
The response warns about reentrancy concerns even with the use of `ReentrancyGuard`, highlighting risks if external contracts can call back into the contract before state changes are finalized.

**Assessment**:  
**Valid Concern**. While the original issue report does not mention reentrancy specifically, this is a significant concern that applies to many scenarios involving external calls. The suggestion is valid but not directly relevant to the issues outlined in the report.

**Recommendations**:  
- Ensure that any external contract calls are made after all internal state changes are finalized to mitigate reentrancy risks.

---

**Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**  
- **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**  
- **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Partially Correct Matches**:  
- **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**  
- **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain transfers**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:  
- **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**  
- **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**

**GPT-Generated Potential Issues (May Be Incorrect)**:  
- **[R-05] Reentrancy Concerns Even with `ReentrancyGuard`**: A valid suggestion regarding reentrancy but not directly related to the original issues.
