}",9069,858,"[H-01] LenderPool: Principal withdrawable is incorrectly calculated if start() is invoked with non-zero start fee
The `_principalWithdrawable` calculated will be more than expected if `_start()` is invoked with a non-zero start fee, because the borrow limit is reduced by the fee, resulting in `totalSupply[id]` not being 1:1 with the borrow limit.

[H-02] PooledCreditLine: termination likely fails because `_principleWithdrawable` is treated as shares
`_principalWithdrawable` is denominated in the borrowAsset, but subsequently treats it as the share amount to be withdrawn.

[M-01] Pool Credit Line May Not Able to Start When `_borrowAsset` is Non ERC20 Compliant Tokens
`IERC20(_borrowAsset).transfer(_to, _fee);`
If the USDT token is supported as `_borrowAsset`, the unsafe version of `.transfer(_to, _fee)` may revert as there is no return value in the USDT token contract’s transfer() implementation (but the IERC20 interface expects a return value).
Function `start()` will break when `_borrowAsset` is USDT or Non ERC20 Compliant Tokens. USDT is one of the most borrowed Asset in DEFI. This may cause losing a lot of potential users.

[M-02] Lack of access control allow anyone to `withdrawInterest()` for any lender
`withdrawInterest()` at a certain time may not be in the best interest of the specific `lender`.
It's unconventional and can potentially cause leak of value for the `lender`. For example, the lender may still want to accrued more interest from the strategy.

[M-03] Potentially depositing at unfavorable rate since anyone can deposit the entire lenderPool to a known strategy at a pre-fixed time
An attacker could keep track of the `totalSupply` of each LenderPool to see if it is more than the `minBorrowAmount`. If so, at startTime, which is pre-announced, the attacker could call `start`, which will trigger `SAVINGS_ACCOUNT.deposit()` of the entire pool assets to mint LP tokens from external strategy, for example, in CompoundYield.
There is potentially a big sum depositing into a known Compound `cToken` contract at a known fixed time. Thus, the attacker could prepare the pool by depositing a fair sum first to lower the exchange rate before calling start in lenderPool. Hence, the deposit of the entire pool could be at a less favourable rate. This also applies to other potential strategies that are yet to be integrated. For example, in Curve pool, the attacker could prime the pool to be very imbalanced first and trigger the deposit and then harvest the arbitrage bonus by bringing the pool back to balance.",5,"pragma solidity 0.7.6;

}",5453,2,3,"The following vulnerabilities were found in the given smart contract code:

1.  **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The contract has a reentrancy vulnerability due to the use of the `nonReentrant` modifier. This modifier does not prevent reentrancy, but rather prevents a contract from calling itself recursively. However, in the given code, the `nonReentrant` modifier is used incorrectly, as it is not properly implemented to prevent reentrancy. To fix this, the contract should use the `ReentrancyGuard` modifier, which is a more secure way to prevent reentrancy.

2.  **Unprotected Function Calls**: The contract has unprotected function calls, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. For example, the `withdrawLiquidity` function calls `withdrawTokensAfterLiquidation`, which in turn calls `withdrawInterest`. This can lead to reentrancy if an attacker calls `withdrawLiquidity` multiple times before the previous call is complete. To fix this, the contract should use the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy.

3.  **Missing Input Validation**: The contract has missing input validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. For example, the `create` function does not validate the input `_borrowAsset`, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker passes an invalid address. To fix this, the contract should add input validation to ensure that the input is valid.

4.  **Unprotected External Calls**: The contract has unprotected external calls, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. For example, the `withdrawLiquidity` function calls `withdrawTokensAfterLiquidation`, which in turn calls `withdrawInterest`. This can lead to reentrancy if an attacker calls `withdrawLiquidity` multiple times before the previous call is complete. To fix this, the contract should use the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy.

5.  **Missing Error Handling**: The contract has missing error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. For example, the `create` function does not handle errors that may occur when calling `SAVINGS_ACCOUNT.approve`. To fix this, the contract should add error handling to ensure that errors are properly handled.

6.  **Unprotected External Function Calls**: The contract has unprotected external function calls, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. For example, the `withdrawLiquidity` function calls `withdrawTokensAfterLiquidation`, which in turn calls `withdrawInterest`. This can lead to reentrancy if an attacker calls `withdrawLiquidity` multiple times before the previous call is complete. To fix this, the contract should use the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy.

7.  **Missing Event Emissions**: The contract has missing event emissions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. For example, the `create` function does not emit an event when the pool is created. To fix this, the contract should add event emissions to ensure that events are properly emitted.

8.  **Unprotected Function Calls with External Contracts**: The contract has unprotected function calls with external contracts, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. For example, the `withdrawLiquidity` function calls `withdrawTokensAfterLiquidation`, which in turn calls `withdrawInterest` on an external contract. This can lead to reentrancy if an attacker calls `withdrawLiquidity` multiple times before the previous call is complete. To fix this, the contract should use the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy.

9.  **Missing Input Validation for External Contracts**: The contract has missing input validation for external contracts, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. For example, the `create` function does not validate the input `_borrowAsset`, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker passes an invalid address. To fix this, the contract should add input validation to ensure that the input is valid.

10. **Unprotected External Function Calls with External Contracts**: The contract has unprotected external function calls with external contracts, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. For example, the `withdrawLiquidity` function calls `withdrawTokensAfterLiquidation`, which in turn calls `withdrawInterest` on an external contract. This can lead to reentrancy if an attacker calls `withdrawLiquidity` multiple times before the previous call is complete. To fix this, the contract should use the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy.

11. **Missing Error Handling for External Contracts**: The contract has missing error handling for external contracts, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. For example, the `create` function does not handle errors that may occur when calling `SAVINGS_ACCOUNT.approve`. To fix this, the contract should add error handling to ensure that errors are properly handled.

**[H-01] LenderPool: Principal withdrawable is incorrectly calculated if start() is invoked with non-zero start fee**

**Report Description**:
The `_principalWithdrawable` calculated will be more than expected if `_start()` is invoked with a non-zero start fee, because the borrow limit is reduced by the fee, resulting in `totalSupply[id]` not being 1:1 with the borrow limit. This could lead to incorrect calculations and potential financial discrepancies.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of incorrect principal withdrawal calculations due to non-zero start fees. This is a critical oversight, as it directly impacts the financial integrity of the contract.

---

**[H-02] PooledCreditLine: termination likely fails because `_principleWithdrawable` is treated as shares**

**Report Description**:
`_principalWithdrawable` is denominated in the borrowAsset, but subsequently treats it as the share amount to be withdrawn. This mismatch in denomination could lead to termination failures and incorrect withdrawal amounts.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of treating `_principalWithdrawable` as shares instead of the borrowAsset. This is a significant flaw that could prevent the contract from functioning as intended.

---

**[M-01] Pool Credit Line May Not Able to Start When `_borrowAsset` is Non ERC20 Compliant Tokens**

**Report Description**:
If the USDT token is supported as `_borrowAsset`, the unsafe version of `.transfer(_to, _fee)` may revert as there is no return value in the USDT token contract’s transfer() implementation (but the IERC20 interface expects a return value). Function `start()` will break when `_borrowAsset` is USDT or Non ERC20 Compliant Tokens. USDT is one of the most borrowed Asset in DEFI. This may cause losing a lot of potential users.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of non-ERC20 compliant tokens like USDT causing the `start()` function to fail. This is a critical issue that could limit the contract's usability and adoption.

---

**[M-02] Lack of access control allow anyone to `withdrawInterest()` for any lender**

**Report Description**:
`withdrawInterest()` at a certain time may not be in the best interest of the specific `lender`. It's unconventional and can potentially cause leak of value for the `lender`. For example, the lender may still want to accrued more interest from the strategy.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of lack of access control in the `withdrawInterest()` function. This is a significant oversight that could lead to financial losses for lenders.

---

**[M-03] Potentially depositing at unfavorable rate since anyone can deposit the entire lenderPool to a known strategy at a pre-fixed time**

**Report Description**:
An attacker could keep track of the `totalSupply` of each LenderPool to see if it is more than the `minBorrowAmount`. If so, at `startTime`, which is pre-announced, the attacker could call `start`, which will trigger `SAVINGS_ACCOUNT.deposit()` of the entire pool assets to mint LP tokens from external strategy, for example, in CompoundYield. There is potentially a big sum depositing into a known Compound `cToken` contract at a known fixed time. Thus, the attacker could prepare the pool by depositing a fair sum first to lower the exchange rate before calling `start` in lenderPool. Hence, the deposit of the entire pool could be at a less favourable rate. This also applies to other potential strategies that are yet to be integrated. For example, in Curve pool, the attacker could prime the pool to be very imbalanced first and trigger the deposit and then harvest the arbitrage bonus by bringing the pool back to balance.

**Match in Response List**:
**No match found**.

**Validation**:
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address the issue of potential unfavorable rates due to pre-fixed deposit times. This is a significant vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract's financial outcomes.
