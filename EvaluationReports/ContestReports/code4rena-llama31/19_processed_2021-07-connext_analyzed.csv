// Outstanding qs:
// - what happens if you have unique user data, but duplicate tx ids?
//   no requires here would catch this, the tx would be properly prepared
//
// - we validate all the inputs but the amount, bidSignature, and encodedBid.
//   bidSignature and encodedBid could be used as slashing later, and their
//   validation is out of scope of this function. But, do we want to be able
//   to use this to send 0-value amounts? basically as some incentivized
//   relayer? would that break bidding?


/// @title TransactionManager
/// @author Connext <support@connext.network>
/// @notice This contract holds the logic to facilitate crosschain transactions.
///         Transactions go through three phases:
///
///         1. Route Auction: User broadcasts to our network signalling their 
///         desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing 
///         commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and 
///         price range.
///
///         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
///         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
///         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
///         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chiain. Upon 
///         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
///         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
///         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
///         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
///         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
///         transaction.
///
///         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
///         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
///         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
///         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
///         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
///         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
///         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
///         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
///         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
///         unlocking the original `amount`.
///
///         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it 
///         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on 
///         each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled 
///         unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for 
///         sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.

}",6657,654,"[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity
The `addLiquidity()` function takes a router address parameter, whose liquidity is increased (instead of assuming that `router` == `msg.sender` like is done on `removeLiquidity()`) on this contract/chain, by transferring the fund amount from router address to this contract if `assetID` != 0 (i.e. ERC20 tokens). However, anyone can call this function on the router’s behalf. For assetID == 0, the Ether transfer via msg.value comes from msg.sender and hence is assumed to be the router itself.
The impact is that this will allow anyone to call this function and arbitrarily move ERC20 tokens from router address to this contract, assuming router has given max approval to this contract and has assetID amount available for transfer. While the router can always remove the liquidity if it doesn’t want to maintain that level of liquidity, this lack of access control or flexibility for a relayer to add liquidity on router’s behalf, may unnecessarily (and without authorization) increase the router’s exposure to protocol risk to more than it desires. See TransactionManager.sol #L88-L98. See also, use of msg.sender in removeLiquidity (#L88-L98).
  [H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks
There is a potential issue in function `removeUserActiveBlocks` and the for loop inside it. I assume you are aware of block gas limits (they may be less relevant on other chains but still needs to be accounted for), so as there is no limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`, it may grow so large that the for loop may never finish. You should consider introducing an upper limit for `activeTransactionBlocks`. Also, a malicious actor may block any account (DDOS) by just calling `prepare` again and again with 0 amount acting as a router. This will push `activeTransactionBlocks` to the specified user until it is no longer possible to remove them from the array.
This is also a gas issue, as function `removeUserActiveBlocks` iterating and assigning large dynamic arrays is very gas-consuming. Consider optimizing the algorithm, e.g. finding the first occurrence, then swap it with the last item, pop the array, and break. Or maybe even using an EnumerableMap, so you can find and remove elements in O(1).
The best solution depends on what the usual number of `activeTransactionBlocks` is. If it is expected to be low (e.g. less than 5), then the current approach will work. But with larger arrays, I expect EnumerableMap would be more efficient.
Because an upper limit will not fully mitigate this issue, as a malicious actor can still DDOS the user by pushing useless txs until this limit is reached and a valid router may not be able to submit new txs. And, because you need to improve both the security and performance of removeUserActiveBlocks; EnumerableMap may be a go-to solution.
  [H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user
During `fulfill()` on the receiving chain, if the user has set up an external contract at `txData.callTo`, the catch blocks for both `IFulfillHelper.addFunds()` and `IFulfillHelper.excute()` perform `transferAsset` to the predetermined fallback address `txData.receivingAddress`.
If `addFunds()` has reverted earlier, `toSend` amount would already have been transferred to the `receivingAddress`. If `execute()` also fails, it is again transferred.
  [H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain function `cancel()`
The cancelling relayer is being paid in `receivingAssetId` on the sendingChain instead of in sendingAssetID. If the user relies on a relayer to cancel transactions, and that receivingAssetId asset does not exist on the sending chain (assuming only sendingAssetID on the sending chain and receivingAssetId on the receiving chain are assured to be valid and present), then the cancel transaction from the relayer will always revert and user’s funds will remain locked on the sending chain.
The impact is that expired transfers can never be cancelled and user funds will be locked forever if user relies on a relayer.
  [H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to IFulfillHelper fails
The function `fulfill` first approves the `callTo` to transfer an amount of toSend tokens and tries to call IFulfillHelper, but if the call fails, it transfers these assets directly. However, in such case the approval is not reset, so a malicous callTo can pull these tokens later:   [M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest
The signature check in `recoverFulfillSignature()` only uses transaction ID (along with the relayer fee) which can be accidentally reused by the user, in which case the older signatures with the older relayer fees can be replayed. The signature should be on the entire digest hashInvariantTransactionData(txData) as indicated in the comment on L306.
The impact is that, If the user signatures are indeed on the digest as indicated by the comment, the signature/address check in fulfill() will fail. If not, they may be accidentally/intentionally replayed with same transaction ID, which also appears to be an outstanding question as indicated by the comment on L12.
  [M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers
The agreement between the `user` and the `router` seems to already happen off-chain because all the fields are required for the initial In `variantTransactionData call already. A router could pretend to take on a user's cross-chain transfer, the user sends their prepare transaction, locking up funds on the sending chain. But then the router simply doesn't respond or responds with a prepare transaction of amount=0.
The user's funds are then locked for the entire expiry time, whereas the router does not have to lock up anything as the amount is 0, even no gas if they simply don't respond. In this way, a router can bid on everything off-chain without a penalty, and take down everyone that accepts the bid.",7,"pragma solidity 0.8.4;

}",3101,5,2,"The following are the vulnerabilities identified in the given solidity code of the smart contract:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: The contract uses the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin, which is a good practice. However, it's essential to ensure that the `nonReentrant` modifier is used correctly to prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. **Unprotected Functions**: Some functions, such as `addLiquidity` and `removeLiquidity`, do not have any checks to prevent malicious users from executing them. It's recommended to add checks to ensure that only authorized users can execute these functions.

3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The contract does not handle errors properly. For example, in the `addLiquidity` function, if the `LibAsset.transferFrom` function fails, the contract will revert with an error message. However, it's not clear how the error message is generated or how it's handled.

4. **Potential Front-Running Vulnerability**: The contract uses a `prepare` function that allows users to prepare a transaction. However, this function does not check if the user has already prepared a transaction with the same `transactionId`. This could lead to a front-running vulnerability, where an attacker could front-run a legitimate user's transaction.

5. **Insecure Use of `msg.value`**: In the `addLiquidity` function, the contract uses `msg.value` to check if the user has sent the correct amount of ether. However, this is not a secure way to check the amount, as it's easy to manipulate the `msg.value` variable.

6. **Missing Checks**: The contract does not check if the `router` parameter is a valid address in the `prepare` function. This could lead to a vulnerability where an attacker could use a malicious router to execute a transaction.

7. **Inconsistent Error Messages**: The contract uses inconsistent error messages, which could make it harder to debug and identify issues.

8. **Missing Input Validation**: The contract does not validate the input parameters properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

9. **Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**: The contract does not have any checks to prevent a denial of service (DoS) attack. An attacker could flood the contract with requests, causing it to run out of gas or become unresponsive.

10. **Insecure Use of `keccak256`**: The contract uses `keccak256` to hash data, but it's not clear if the hash function is used correctly. It's recommended to use a secure hash function, such as `keccak256` with a salt, to prevent collisions.

11. **Missing Checks for `txData`**: The contract does not check if the `txData` parameter is a valid `TransactionData` struct in the `fulfill` function. This could lead to a vulnerability where an attacker could use a malicious `txData` to execute a transaction.

12. **Inconsistent Use of `bytes32`**: The contract uses `bytes32` inconsistently throughout the code. It's recommended to use a consistent naming convention, such as `keccak256`, to make the code easier to read and understand.

13. **Missing Checks for `relayerFee`**: The contract does not check if the `relayerFee` parameter is a valid amount in the `fulfill` function. This could lead to a vulnerability where an attacker could use a malicious `relayerFee` to execute a transaction.

14. **Insecure Use of `recoverFulfillSignature`**: The contract uses `recoverFulfillSignature` to recover the sender's address from a signature. However, this function does not check if the signature is valid. It's recommended to use a secure function, such as `recoverFulfillSignature` with a valid signature, to prevent collisions.

15. **Missing Checks for `cancel`**: The contract does not check if the `cancel` parameter is a valid transaction in the `cancel` function. This could lead to a vulnerability where an attacker could use a malicious `cancel` to execute a transaction.

16. **Inconsistent Error Messages**: The contract uses inconsistent error messages, which could make it harder to debug and identify issues.

17. **Missing Input Validation**: The contract does not validate the input parameters properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

18. **Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**: The contract does not have any checks to prevent a denial of service (DoS) attack. An attacker could flood the contract with requests, causing it to run out of gas or become unresponsive.

19. **Insecure Use of `keccak256`**: The contract uses `keccak256` to hash data, but it's not clear if the hash function is used correctly. It's recommended to use a secure hash function, such as","### **Comparison and Evaluation**

#### **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**

**Report Description**:  
The `addLiquidity()` function allows anyone to add liquidity on behalf of a router by transferring ERC20 tokens from the router's address to the contract. This lack of access control can lead to unauthorized increases in the router's exposure to protocol risk. While the router can remove liquidity, this design flaw may result in unintended financial risks.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Unprotected Functions""**.

**Validation**:  
**Correct**. The response identifies the lack of access control in the `addLiquidity` function, which aligns with the issue described. It correctly highlights the risk of unauthorized execution of this function, addressing the core concern.

---

#### **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**

**Report Description**:  
The `activeTransactionBlocks` array can grow indefinitely, leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. A malicious actor can repeatedly call the `prepare` function with a zero amount, causing the array to grow until it becomes unmanageable. This can also lead to high gas consumption and inefficiency in the `removeUserActiveBlocks` function.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of a DoS attack but does not specifically address the issue of the `activeTransactionBlocks` array growing indefinitely or the gas inefficiency in the `removeUserActiveBlocks` function. The response is generic and misses critical details.

---

#### **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**

**Report Description**:  
During the `fulfill()` function, if both `addFunds()` and `execute()` fail, the `transferAsset` function is called twice, leading to a double transfer of funds to the fallback address. This can result in a loss of funds for the router.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which involves a double transfer of funds due to improper error handling in the `fulfill()` function.

---

#### **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**

**Report Description**:  
The `cancel()` function pays the relayer in `receivingAssetId` on the sending chain, which may not exist. If the relayer cannot be paid, the transaction will revert, and the user's funds will remain locked indefinitely.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which involves a potential locking of user funds due to incorrect asset handling in the `cancel()` function.

---

#### **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**

**Report Description**:  
The `fulfill` function approves the `callTo` address to transfer tokens but does not reset the approval if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails. This leaves the contract vulnerable to a malicious `callTo` address pulling tokens later.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which involves a failure to reset token approvals after a failed external call.

---

#### **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

**Report Description**:  
The `recoverFulfillSignature()` function only uses the transaction ID for signature verification, which can lead to replay attacks. The signature should be based on the entire digest to ensure security.

**Match in Response List**:  
**No match found**.

**Validation**:  
**Incorrect**. The response list does not address this issue, which involves a potential replay attack due to insufficient signature verification.

---

#### **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers**

**Report Description**:  
A malicious router can block cross-chain transfers by submitting a `prepare` transaction with a zero amount, locking the user's funds without locking any of its own. This can lead to a denial of service for the user.

**Match in Response List**:  
Matches with the issue titled **""Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack""**.

**Validation**:  
**Partially Correct**. The response identifies the risk of a DoS attack but does not specifically address the issue of a malicious router blocking cross-chain transfers by submitting zero-amount transactions. The response is generic and misses critical details.

---

### **Summary of Matches and Gaps**

**Correct Matches**:

- **[H-01] Anyone can arbitrarily add router liquidity**

**Partially Correct Matches**:

- **[H-02] `activeTransactionBlocks` are vulnerable to DDoS attacks**
- **[M-02] Malicious router can block cross-chain-transfers**

**Missed Issues from Issue Report**:

- **[H-03] Router liquidity on receiving chain can be double-dipped by the user**
- **[H-04] Expired transfers will lock user funds on the sending chain**
- **[H-05] Approval is not reset if the call to `IFulfillHelper` fails**
- **[M-01] Signatures use only tx ID instead of entire digest**

---

### **Conclusion**

The response list covers some of the issues but misses critical vulnerabilities and risks identified in the issue report. While it correctly identifies access control issues and generic DoS risks, it fails to address specific problems like double transfers, locked funds, improper approval handling, and replay attacks. The response list should be expanded to include these issues for comprehensive coverage.",3,2,2,14,"```
1. Unprotected Functions
```","To calculate the **Average Precision (AP)** for the given query, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rank of the true positive**:
   - The true positive is ""Unprotected Functions"".
   - In the ranked list of predictions, ""Unprotected Functions"" appears at rank 2.

2. **Calculate the precision at that rank**:
   - Precision at rank 2 (\( P@2 \)) is calculated as the number of true positives up to rank 2 divided by the rank.
   - Since there is only one true positive up to rank 2, \( P@2 = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

3. **Compute the Average Precision (AP)**:
   - Since there is only one true positive, the AP is simply the precision at the rank where the true positive appears.
   - Therefore, \( AP = 0.5 \).

**Output**:
