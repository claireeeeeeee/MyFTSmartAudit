1. Smart Legal Contracts

These are digital versions of traditional legal agreements, with terms directly written into code. They automatically enforce contractual obligations when conditions are met, providing transparency and reducing reliance on intermediaries.

2. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

DAOs are organizations governed by smart contracts, operating without centralized control. Members make decisions collectively, and the organization's rules are enforced automatically by the underlying code

3. Application Logic Contracts (ALCs)

These contracts manage specific functions within decentralized applications (DApps), ensuring they operate autonomously and securely. ALCs are integral to the functionality of various blockchain-based applications.

4. Token Contracts

These manage the creation and transfer of digital tokens on blockchain platforms. Tokens can represent cryptocurrencies, assets, or access rights within a network. Standards like ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are common examples.

5. Crowdfunding Contracts

These facilitate fundraising by collecting contributions from multiple participants. They automatically enforce funding goals and refund mechanisms, ensuring transparency and trust in crowdfunding campaigns.

6. Voting Contracts

Utilized in governance systems, these contracts enable secure and transparent voting processes. They ensure that votes are counted accurately and that the results are tamper-proof, enhancing trust in electoral processes.

7. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Contracts

These manage the creation and transfer of unique digital assets, representing ownership of items like digital art, collectibles, or real estate. NFT contracts ensure the authenticity and provenance of these assets.

8. Payment Contracts

These facilitate the automatic transfer of funds between parties based on predefined conditions, streamlining transactions and reducing the need for intermediaries.
